Installs the librealsense library for the Intel Realsense cameras on the NVIDIA Jetson platform.

Installation is broken up into two parts. The shell file 'installLibrealsense.sh' installs dependences for the librealsense library on the Jetson, including libusb-dev and the glfw library, and then builds the library and installs it.

There is also a shell file for installing Qt Creator, which can be used to work with the supplied Qt Creator project files included in the installation.
